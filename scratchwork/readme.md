# The old scrap box, yellowing with bit rot and almost forgotten. But still surprisingly useful!

Here we keep snippits of code that are *only useful for humans*. That means that they are never called from the computer and likely don't even work (because they hardcode fake ids, etc).

Hoarding is bad, but when it's digital txt in it's *own scrapbook folder* than.
